This repository is for Assignment B3 and B4.

## Assignment B3

[You can reach the Shiny app by this link.](http://hanqiuxu.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-HanqiuXu)

My choice of the assignment: **Option A - BC Liquor app**

I added 3 feature to the BC Liquor app:
1. Add an image of BC Liquor Store to the UI
2. Add a change to the output by showing the number of results found whenever the filters change
3. Use the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive table

I made this app based on the tutorial given by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/). 

Here is the [link](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server/blob/master/bcl/data/bcl-data.csv) to the original dataset.

## Assignment B4

My choice of the assignment: **Option C - Shiny App**

[You can reach the Shiny app by this link.](https://hanqiuxu.shinyapps.io/assignment-b4-HanqiuXu/)

To improve this shiny app, I added the following three features:
1. Add an input to choose color for the plot
2. Add a download button to download the filtered data
3. Place plots and table in separate tabs
